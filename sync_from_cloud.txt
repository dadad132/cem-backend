# Instructions to sync database from cloud server to local

# 1. Download the database from your cloud server
# Run this on your LOCAL machine:
scp root@102.214.189.191:/root/cem-backend/data.db ./data.db

# This will replace your local database with the one from the cloud server
# You'll have all the same tickets, users, and email settings

# Note: Make sure to stop your local server first before copying!
