# Task Date Ranges on Calendar - Quick Guide

## ✅ Feature Updated!

Tasks now display across their **entire date range** on the calendar, just like projects!

## 📅 How It Works

### Tasks with Start Date and Due Date
If a task has **both** `start_date` and `due_date`:
- The task appears on **EVERY day** between start and due date (inclusive)
- Example: Task from Nov 1 to Nov 5 shows on Nov 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

### Tasks with Only Due Date
If a task has **only** `due_date` (no start_date):
- The task appears **only on the due date**
- This is the traditional behavior

### Tasks with Only Start Date
If a task has **only** `start_date` (no due_date):
- The task appears **only on the start date**

## 🎨 Visual Display

### Day View (Detailed)
Tasks spanning multiple days show their date range:
```
🔥 Website Redesign
   01/11 - 05/11 - In Progress • John Doe
```

### Week/Month View (Compact)
Same task appears on multiple cells with icon and title:
```
🔥 10:00    (if has time)
Website Redesign
```

## 📝 How to Set Task Dates

When creating or editing a task, you can set:

1. **Start Date**: When the task begins
2. **Start Time**: Optional time the task starts
3. **Due Date**: When the task is due
4. **Due Time**: Optional time the task is due

### Examples:

**Multi-day Task:**
- Start Date: November 1, 2025
- Due Date: November 5, 2025
- Result: Shows on Nov 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Single-day Task:**
- Start Date: November 3, 2025 (at 10:00 AM)
- Due Date: November 3, 2025 (at 2:00 PM)
- Result: Shows on Nov 3 only

**Deadline-only Task:**
- Start Date: (empty)
- Due Date: November 10, 2025
- Result: Shows on Nov 10 only
